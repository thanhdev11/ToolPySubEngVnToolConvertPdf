All right so I'm with you guys is excited about an amazing four days a kid

69
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
Because

70
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
We are absolutely thrilled

71
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
2B kit with you

72
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
Being an absolutely interesting yet

73
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Hasn't it

74
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:52,351
He's such an interesting yet and one of the things I think that's been great of this interesting yet

75
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,167
Is realizing the power of actual events

76
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
And we

77
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,543
We really really happy about the actual events

78
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,151
As many many benefits and there's some things that we need to do

79
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,735
To make sure we get the most out of it

80
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:14,367
Can I just start off by asking everyone do we all want to make sure we get the most out of these this this

81
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,719
You know like we want them we want to get we want to squeeze every

82
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,023
Value added

83
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,655
Well that's on the same page Disney Lee 500 people registered for the event

84
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,751
Live right now about 200 people says a lot of energy yet

85
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,335
If we were in a live event to be quite a sizable rude

86
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,991
Here we allow on an actual event and aren't we lucky to live in a day and age will be get to do that service

87
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
Let's remind ourselves first

88
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
On some of the benefits of the actual events

89
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,671
You didn't have to travel anywhere to do this

90
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,535
You didn't have to organise a babysitter a dog sitter you didn't have to get accommodation

91
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,631
You don't have to sleep in some bed and some hotel that you don't want to sleep in

92
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
You didn't have to have crappy airplane food to come and see us

93
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,519
All of those expenses

94
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
At that go with traveling to an event

95
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,223
Is all of that you didn't have to do an end you know you get to wear whatever comfy clothes you want to wear

96
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,599
You don't have to do your hair none of your on video and he can sit back and relax so

97
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
You know

98
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
Is that those are those are some of the benefits

99
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,071
And in his some of the downside

100
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,143
The first downside as we can't see

101
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
So I have no way

102
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
I Hannah Rose could you

103
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Please check

104
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
Connect Minds Facebook

105
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
I am getting some messenger paintings

106
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Was I saying

107
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,319
There are some downsides number one ikonta I can't see you

108
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
So I don't know if you've walked away from your computer

109
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,487
Or if you're you know

110
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Scrolling

111
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,631
Facebook Harvey I don't know what you're doing some but no way to give you a nudge so

112
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:07,519
That's supposed supposed but you get to be as responsible as

113
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
As you lie

114
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Add to get the most out of it

115
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
Does that make sense you get to through you

116
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
The second thing is

117
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
I'm not going to know how engaged you I accept what you doing in the chat box

118
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,415
So the chat box is a little hand.

119
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:30,303
I know if you're writing furiously or taking lots of notes just hit the hand up this is so I so I know

120
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,143
Is that is a few things about dream that we want to make sure we understand

121
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,775
So is that on one side is the checkbox and everyone's in the

122
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,895
In the in the chat box right now yeah but you're there yet you're typing in the chat box

123
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
I'm not going to be able to see right now live 197 people's I'm questions if they go they

124
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
Now does everyone see with a Q and A boxes

125
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
There is a Q and I

126
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,487
Little box as well

127
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
That is a place to put questions that they will stay there

128
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,887
So please use the chat box for

129
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
Yep Salva someone will be on that please use the checkbox for engagement being with me when you have a quiz

130
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
Christian that you need me to make sure they get

131
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
How to use the Q in eyeball

132
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Okay

133
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
Rarely ever unhappy with that

134
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,575
The other downside of

135
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
Someone just talked into the q-and-a box there

136
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
Allanson still can't get access to the workbook

137
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,631
Everyone's going to access to it hey it's just a public workbook so there's a link you just click it you should go ahead download

138
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
On it

139
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
Will make a copy of it

140
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,759
Allen's having problem so is Len

141
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
A few people having problems

142
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
Many to say easy just click it

143
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
Link Link sharing

144
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,471
Gosari secondly helped I get the lake I'm going to be sharing the the workbook on-screen anyway

145
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,799
And of course I got the workbook behind me so now I'm going to miss that

146
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
You know we will I

147
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
We would do it

148
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Alright cool

149
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
Awesome so the other downside of of a bit she lived is obviously we can't just hand you work books and they

150
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,695
Minnesota things so there's a few requirements for you to get the most out of this event

151
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
You know I would really like to make sure that you have good internet

152
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
And I know that sounds like a real

153
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
A real basic thing to say

154
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
But I can't control your internet

155
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
And your Wi-Fi or whatever you're using

156
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
The place just realize that you know

157
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
If you've got

158
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,919
Teenage people in Hassett want to download big movies of things like that

159
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,783
If that's going to spoil your internet down that's going to slow your experience down does that make sense like

160
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
I can't I can't do anything about that

161
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,671
Please make sure you have that available

162
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
I am that you're ready

163
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,095
Throughout the weekend I am going to be asking for some people to jump on jump on and get life coaching with me

164
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
And if you ask someone that wants to know what I'd really love to have a coaching session with Chris I'll be demonstrating it

165
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
Everything if you want to have that

166
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
You can put your hand I would say I would really like to now if you do

167
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,223
Is a few things that I'm going to ask number one you must have a good video

168
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
You must have good clear video

169
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,831
And and so please don't be in a place that has

170
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
Cute background noise

171
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,023
And we will love love you we care about you but if you jump on and you're at so I didn't it is

172
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Wendy and his dog barking and

173
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
Well maybe this kid's yellin Jose

174
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,727
That's not going to be a great video for everyone else and I'm going to have to say I'm sorry I can't whip

175
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,847
Sorry I didn't make sense of you do want it if you do want to just make sure you're ready

176
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
So that

177
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,247

I'm not sure why at 3 or 4 if you can't download it

194
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,759
Maybe it's cuz you're on your phone maybe it's some sort of web browser which is way above my

195
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,087
My pay grade sucks

The super-conscious record that is

207
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
That is the absolute

208
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
That is the absolute

209
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
Focus that's what we're up to

210
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,487
The coaches who are in the certification

211
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,303
You learn a lot more than just the Rico

212
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,911
I'm going to ask all coaches who is certified or getting certified

213
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
In this event we're only focusing on

214
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
The recall

215
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
We're only going to focus on the Rica and the reason is is is many different groups of people that are at this event some of yours

Some of your insipid punch nastri and is some of your in the yard that said

00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
It's Wherever You Are

219
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,559
We're all going to be going through the same journey together

220
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
So do you have a beginner's mindset

221
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751

Amazing event with that one

224
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
One intention

225
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
What did they say they wanted to

226
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,991
I'm going to be sharing the workbook yeah so that you guys can come see it with me

00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
So we'll move through the welcome section

228
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
My wallet my

229
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,023
Remember in this training how you show up is how you show up in life

230
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Okay

231
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Xavier self

232
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
Because one of the most interesting things is

233
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
Wherever you go there you are

234
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Sure

235
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,567
So how you're showing up how you hear how you're interacting

236
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,895
Whether what you doing it's really nice to realize that

237
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:14,015
Where do you go to eat while you take yourself with you so you get to see

238
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
How do you show up

239
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,903
It's so interesting to me all information is good information

240
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
Please be on time for every session and breaks

241
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:29,119
Whenever I have a break I'll say hey guys we have a break I'll give you the time and then I'll be starting again on time

242
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
Please be on time

243
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,239
I want to great things about being a b**** levantis you don't have to you know

244
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,871
Push past anyone to quickly shoot off to the bathroom while you can have whatever snacks you liking

245
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
And do what you like so there's lots of big lots of good stuff

246
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Stay alert

247
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
Make sure that your tia I mean

248
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,623
One of the hardest things is if I've already explained something

249
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,463
And someone was sleeping and drifting off and then we go to do an exercise

250
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
And I haven't listened

251
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,863
And then what happens is that then I have to re-explain it again and can you see how much

252
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,191
I'm a waste by doing that does that make sense

253
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
I need you alert I need you getting it

254
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,615
And are we going to be going through some really really intensive processes

255
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
We going to start off slow

256
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,735
I'm going to build right out by the end of this for days guys

257
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,319
You going to be doing the recode on some things like the double bubble

258
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,951
You going to go from not knowing how to do anything to learning the RICO to muscle testing to all the commands

259
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Tennis grips

260
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:33,119
To doing big processes you going to end this for days knowing how to do it it's going to be

261
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
People on

262
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
And I really want you to get that cuz if you are

263
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
If you ignore and you could easily be doing this I mean I could be sitting on the edge of your you're

264
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,247
You could be sitting on your bed you could have your legs up you could have your phone and hear your laptop here

265
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:54,367
You know you could have Netflix going off in the background and you could be not getting it at all

266
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,255
And then guess what you going to get to the day too and I'm going to say right now we're doing this session you going to I don't know what to do

267
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,071
Is that make sense I don't know what to do

268
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
And if that's you

269
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
You going to let the other person there

270
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,495
You can feed a beginner

271
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,335
You can be new but can we all agree right now

272
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Is if you haven't listened

273
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
And if you haven't asked you a question

274
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,271
Annual letting us hold down because we don't get to have the session

275
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,111
Daniel Patterson has to come along and explain it all to you

276
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,695
Does that make sense so please don't be that person

277
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
3000 actually listen super fully do any exercise

278
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
I will ask a specific question

279
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
I would say

280
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
Does everyone know what we're doing

281
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
And how

282
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
To do it

283
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,175
1-hour expecting is it running say yes we know it's because I'm confused about what to do

284
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
As long as you know what you're going to practice it doesn't matter with you know how to do it yet that's what we going to go to crack

285
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,951
But I really need your energy is it's very important

286
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,023
Every single one of you have a responsibility

287
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
To everyone else on this cult

288
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:12,191
And that responsibility is to be here to get this information and do

289
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
Your absolute best

290
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
Is that okay just to do your best

291
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,663
And to be there to go for now we have some people to let 10/10

292
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Confidence

293
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
Where my certified coaches give me a 10 if that's you I can say some of the many who is a 10/10

294
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
Give me a record right now I'm good

295
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Awesome

296
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:36,255
So that's amazing 10/10 people here

297
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,863
That if you're is there who is brand new who's an absolute zero

298
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,495
Who's brand-new going high on 20 I think I'll I don't know what's going on

299
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
Now what I've looked at is there is an equal amount what relative is it equal amount of people who have

300
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
No experience

301
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
And people fully certified

302
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,831
So you going to have a great range you're going to be able to find others

303
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
To work with the connect with hook upgrade experience some if Nan is going to be awesome

304
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
A bunch of December in the middle hey

305
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
You like I feel like I'm at 5 you know

306
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
It's all good

307
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:19,775
It's different people here and we all need to do one thing and that is commit to being here

308
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
And buying fully out and going for it

309
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,895
So I really hope that you're making that decision in your mind

310
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
Keep yourself hydrated

311
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:32,319
Eat good food those are thing again a great benefit of this you might be sitting in your office

312
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,671
You might be sitting in your Lounge room I might be on that the TV

313
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:43,071
And they might be a bunch of family walking around going who's that weird crazy red-headed through than what the heck is he talking about I want to watch

314
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
Wherever I am

315
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,519
You get to actively participate and be there and get the most out of the soup please

316
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
To use the question box

317
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:57,151
And I also realize that I will go see every question

318
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,223
Yeah I don't answer every single one

319
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,783
And it's not because it's a bad question

320
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
It was simply because

321
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,439
I have the answer to that coming up in LA today or latest session

322
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,327
Put the questions in that you think of right I will be scrolling and scanning and looking through them

323
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,423
I will answer them all they will get answered by the end of the weekend

324
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
But I want on Samoan them in the minute

325

We will be doing a live demonstration I think we're going to do do multiple life demonstrations are

326
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Every single day

And then you're going to go and do it

00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,127
Pipenv with us baby around 6

348
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
This is going to be a great 4 days

349
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,503
And I want you just before week we really begin

350
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Is consider

351
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
Everything you think you know

352
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
In our

353
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,535
Consider it like what you think I know this for sure will I'm right about this because I think in this next

354
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
School days

355
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,911
Summer things that you thought was completely true about yourself about the world about what's possible

356
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
I think it's going to shift a little bit

357
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,751
I think it kind of shift a little bit

358
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,079
Which is which is really really cool starts

359
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:07,199
Here is how to get the most out of this workshop and I want everyone committed to these one so

360
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:12,319
Give me a number one if you're ready to play. Whatever that means to you you're ready to

361
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
The go to 10/10

362
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,952
You're going to make it happen number to take loads and notes

363
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,096
Wait with footnotes sections in the workbook for years are those of you haven't been able to download it yet

364
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
I don't know why

365
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,448
But this is the workbook so you're saying it anyway

366
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
And

367
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,312
Take loads and nuts write notes being note taker

368
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
Ask plenty of questions

369
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
Asking a question at Lisa gets off I'll say hey I'm going to cover that later or you know that's a good?

370
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
Concert now

371
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
Remember

372
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:49,696
Every week on a Thursday my time a Wednesday your time I do a Q&A session

373
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:52,512
So they'll be some questions and it just far too big

374
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
Bullets

375
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Container wearing for the next 4 days

376
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:00,704
And I'll simply say hi I'm going to I'm going to postpone that question to ask you and isolation

377
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Everything is a learning

378
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Okay

379
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,384
Everything is a learning watching how I work with others watching yourself

380
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
Watching other people's questions

381
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Coaches

382
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,552
One of the best things that you get to get out of this Workshop

383
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
Is you get to see

384
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
What other

385
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
People are asking

386
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Right

387
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,792
You get to go all that's what they don't understand yet

388
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,144
So that's that's what I need to make sure I explain to my people

389
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,984
Select a very big benefit everything is a learning

390
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,592
Next be responsible you're able to choose your response

391
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,968
You're able to be the one I hit his what I want to make sure we get what I will do

392
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,040
Is make sure we going to give you everything that we've said

393
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
Going to Absolute detail

394
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,208
If you step-by-step template instructions and Powell you ask you a question

395
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
Hey kids what you have to do

396
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,816
You have to be willing

397
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,632
To get a little bit uncomfortable

398
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,008
You have to be willing to push yourself you have to be willing

399
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,104
Did go and give it a try you have to be willing

400
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,456
You are responsible for your own learning I simply

401
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
Cannot

402
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
I reach into your brain

403
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,600
And Implement a Ricoh chip

404
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,928
You need to learn how to do that you're completely capable

405
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,512
It's not a human being on the planet that confident how to do this

406
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
And we all must remember

407
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,864
There is so many different

408
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,192
Experience levels that are in this group

409
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
Some people have done

410
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
Love the feelings for years and

411
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,848
This is just an extra thing that Eddie

412
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,432
Some people are completely nude on what the heck if I got myself into

413
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,784
Wherever you are your job is to get as far as possible in the next

414
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
Be coachable

415
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Be coachable

416
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,976
I'm not here trying to tell you what to do with your life

417
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,912
I don't know everything you should say I don't have as much experience as you and relationships as

418
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,752
I don't even have as much experience on the planet

419
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
As many of you

420
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm not here to say that I'm

421
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,152
I'm so depressed that can tell you everything he's doing your life

422
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,224
What I know is I know how to do the recode

423
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,784
I know how to teach it in so it's okay

424
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,344
I'm going to teach you to get in the right structure

425
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,928
How to do the the RICO to the best of my ability

426
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
And I need you to be coachable

427
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:37,120
And what that means is is some of your old learning some of your old ways of doing things I just need you

428
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,144
You to pop them

429
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
What I mean by that is

430
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Is

431
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,544
In order for me to share my way in the way that we do it

432
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,872
I need you not to be doing it in some of your old ways

433
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
Is that is that fair enough

434
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,480
Try it my way

435
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,808
Try it this way so you can actually experience it

436
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
And then at the end if you go you know what

437
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
His way sucks

438
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
You can go back to your old way

439
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,792
Does that make sense it's not like you're going to break it

440
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
I need you to be out at least try the way that I would like you to do the recode so you can

441
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
At least at least an hour

442
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
Is that fair enough

443
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,152
Number 8 you must get outside your comfort zone

444
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Okay

445
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
You must you must push yourself get outside your comfort zone

446
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:32,160
Tell me you are going to absolutely dislike some of the science that we're going to go through today

447
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,720
But it's very important for others

448
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,328
Some of you were going to love the science between against the actually doing it you're going to freak out

449
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,984
Tell me you were going to Tawana do systemizing and go Chris's. Systemizing up and I was going to

450
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,056
Following the system I want to do it my own way

451
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,408
You're all going to try to create

452
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
Different ways of do that you want to do it

453
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,760
And I'm going to say

454
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
This is the way we go

455
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,856
Set Embrace frustration

456
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,976
When you're about to learn something as big as the Ricard

457
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
It's very likely

458
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
That they might be times

459
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
When you're not getting it

460
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
When you might be getting a little bit frustrated

461
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
Is that true

462
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
You might get a little bit of noise

463
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,896
That's the time Tulane n

464
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
And make it happen

465
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Embrace that

466
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,856
Because we are going to be doing big things now

467
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,208
There's no way for you to screw another person up

468
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
If I do a session

469
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,816
And I do recall

470
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,168
What will that person if I do it wrong

471
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
What will happen

472
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,544
And it's a it's a beautiful fear

473
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,384
And basically from place I wanted to write by this person

474
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
What one of the things that we do with the ricota's is recreated container which says you know only what needs to be treated

475
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Can be presented

476
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Answer

477
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,184
We create a really really really safe container

478
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,744
And remember when you doing recode

479
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
You giving instructions to their field

480
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
They didn't except

481
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
The instructions or not

482
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,216
Sorry you know it's it's a it's a two-person game

483
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:26,336
We ask permission is this many things that ensure that all you're doing

484
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
Is removing some resistance

485
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,688
And and you know what

486
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,552
You remove some resistance and they want to go out there and recreate it

487
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,232
They can go create the resistance again if they really want it. Quite good at that

488
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,120
So the worst case is that the other person doesn't really get a result from Eureka

489
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
That's it that's the worst-case

490
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,544
At your absolute worst case

491
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
However

492
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,688
Most of the time even that doesn't happen because bad so involved in this process as well

493
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
Not picking up and help

494
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,784
So you really don't have anything to worry about

495
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,552
When it comes

496
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,648
Thanks sorry everyone committed to all of those

497
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Yeah

498
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
Everyone's ready for a good weekend

499
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,328
I need you to hold everyone else accountable

500
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,912
If you're here for these Fordyce yolen

501
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
We're going to push yourselves we're going to go through resistance

502
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:31,104
When you see some of your other attendees frustrated it's your time

503
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,664
The dig your well before you're thirsty

504
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,784
What that means is if you see someone else they don't know how to get the Google Drive like maybe you can help

505
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
Maybe someone out here is it needs to do that Devastation again because I really didn't get it you can jump in and help them

506
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Does that make sense

507
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
It's it's your

508
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,120
Responsibility as well to dig your well before you're thirsty

509
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
And that's a beautiful metaphor meaning

510
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
They when you need the help

511
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,336
If the group sees you always there helping when you stick your hand up with some help

512
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Who do you think that they're going to hell

513
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
This is the person

514
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Where am I at least people

515
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,064
One of the ways that we can be in a relationship is aloof

516
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,672
And the aloof person it just hangs out of here I don't type in the chat box

517
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,256
Better pray that they create themselves this

518
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,072
As I separate other people haven't typed in

519
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,864
And it's okay

520
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,400
And if that's the way that

521
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
That you want to re-type my

522
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
Suggestion however

523
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Would be

524
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,848
There are amazing people in this group

525
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,736
And if you don't make yourself knowing

526
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,064
Send the people in this group how will they know that you need help

527
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:51,488
If you go outside you sometimes just going outside of your comfort zone

528
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,792
The help and get someone else ordered

529
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,584
That's that's a big step for you

530
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,912
We need to move the whole group across the line

531
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:04,032
Are together so you are going to Chris but that's that's just simply not my responsibility notice

532
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
Notice where you go with that

533
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,176
Learning this work is huge I remember I accrued for Anthony Robbins

534
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,200
When was that

535
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
Che 2008

536
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
And

537
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
And Tony said to Migos

538
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Chris

539
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
You're going to be the

540
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,256
The Breakthrough specialist

541
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,096
Say WhatsApp he said when

542
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,936
When someone is freaking out and they run out

543
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,288
The team's going to find you and you're the one that's going to get him back in the room

544
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,360
And I remember that time I went

545
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
I don't want to be that person Tony

546
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,736
I came here to sit here and modal everything that you're saying

547
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
And then I realized it was the biggest gift

548
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
Because the people that were

549
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,208
But having the hardest time was where I go to learn my coaching the best

550
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:00,096
Isn't that the best the ones that even with Tony's coaching

551
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
Still had a hard time

552
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,168
And you know

553
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,960
Alan Alan the heck of a lot

554
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:11,872
And so just remember if you really want to master this way if you want to sniff out and find the people having the hottest time

555
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,432
Because they knew what you're going to find the ones

556
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,992
And if you can then help them to get it

557
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:23,648
Even when everything that I've done still gets into nearly get it and then you're the one that gets Madeline

558
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
How much confidence

559
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Does that give you

560
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,304
So those of you who are confident the 10/10 coaches

561
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,656
Oh I'm looking at you going I just give me people to get frustrated here

562
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:39,008
This is your time to lock this learning in at such a date label

563
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,312
Does that make sense this is your time

564
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,688
I'll help you with this I'll personally

565
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Guide you through this WIC

566
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
Let's get a serving together

567
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,344
Let's really go through this together

568
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
And taking that next level of responsibility

569
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,512
Because that's when that's when you'll going to get the most out of this weekend

570
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:06,656
I got the most out of it by doing that it wasn't already already saying what he told about how he doesn't multiple times

571
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
I got the most out of it

572
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,032
When someone was running out because something Tony it said had triggered

573
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,872
Some serious negative emotions of the my job is to get out there

574
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
Commandeered

575
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,296
Shift them and get them back so I hope you guys are stupid committed to realize there's so much more

576
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
At this event

577
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,928
Then just what I'm going to be talking about so so much more

578
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Start

579
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Hit the core

580
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
Premise and the court roots

581
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,608
Please sir please

582
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,960
Quite decent and really understand the first one is your not

583
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Broken

584
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,824
There is nothing wrong with you

585
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,688
You don't need anything outside of you to fix you

586
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
You are home

587
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,016
You are complete

588
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,832
You have everything that you need you need

589
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
There is no

590
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,160
Mistake you are not broken

591
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
Everything that you need

592
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
Did create anything that you want

593
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
In

594
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:10,400
Inuit superconscious and yourself punches that's in you

595
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,472
There is nothing outside of you

596
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,544
It's all you you are not broken

597
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,592
You're not broken

598
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,176
You're going to learn how to use your superconscious

599
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,760
For you and then for others who also

600
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
A superconscious

601
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
Number two

602
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,904
You are superconscious you are

603
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,488
You have tapped into it at various times in your life

604
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,560
You have experienced superconscious

605
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
You are stupid

606
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,168
If you by the way can I ask who's had a great

607
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,544
Who's had a great experience from a RICO give me a yes if you

608
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Awesome

609
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
I didn't do it

610
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:06,976
Anna didn't do it roastin. Your coach didn't do it

611
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
If you have had a great experience from the recode

612
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,912
We open space

613
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
For you to do it

614
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
Does that make sense

615
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
It's you doing it

616
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,408
When we connect to that

617
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,296
Feel the super-conscious filled with you when joining you like two drops in the ocean

618
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
Realizing that right by the ocean

619
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Is that make sense

620
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Is

621
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,584
In the pond is many drops of water then we will realize all way the pond

622
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,144
7 we connect at that level

623
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
Family can make

624
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
But it was always you

625
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
It was always you

626
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,824
Yeah in fact

627
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,896
Anytime you've had a Keeling

628
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,248
It's mostly you and we know this through the placebo

629
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,880
The placebo says that there's an inert substance

630
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
That creates a change

631
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,488
30% of results

632
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,536
Come down to the placebo

633
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,352
What's it what is that you know what

634
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
I get annoyed at the word

635
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
But it's the only one we have 22 s***

636
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:26,592
Say the pharmaceutical industry has even taken at Power away

637
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
Encoded a placebo

638
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Think about it

639
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
What is that really

640
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
They shouldn't say placebo effect

641
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
They should say self-belief

642
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,232
Think about it and if we change the woods

643
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:49,120
Imagine if they said all yeah we tested this drug against the self-belief effect

644
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,168
And the self-belief

645
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
That old bat that created at all

646
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,360
Can you see how they've taken a away with that one word

647
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,456
So what is the placebo effect

648
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,064
The placebo effect says that it had nothing in it other than

649
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,624
Sugar a sugar pill or saline

650
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,744
I injection but the same result happened just because the person believed it would happen

651
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,376
What you think they did they ask testing a part of been

652
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:25,728
That created a new reality they literally did the super-conscious work

653
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
They literally did it

654
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,080
But Pharmaceuticals cool that you know

655
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Play Stay by

656
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,688
Take it they take the power up I say to know it is a fit

657
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,248
This thing at tie you know it's freaking nuts

658
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,600
30% of all result can be put down to one thing self-belief

659
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
Elite

660
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
Who's with me on that

661
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
Self-belief is the placebo

662
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
Answer

663
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,376
You always being superconscious

664
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,216
And they can't even high they even they even hit the

665
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,776
They meaning you know the big drug companies

666
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,056
They had to admit

667
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
That is another effect

668
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,176
And and they decided to not call it that

669
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
EE

670
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,784
Because it might have got people believing in themselves a bit

671
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,368
It's a 40%

672
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
Across-the-board can be put down

673
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,976
Just to the placebo

674
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Yeah

675
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,096
Mike just typed and he says I'm a pharmacist

676
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,424
And they don't want you to know you can heal yourself exactly

677
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,776
Right on Mike I love that what a great addition especially from a pharmacist

678
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,848
So that the patient of taking it and put it over there

679
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,224
It's a when we do the super-conscious work with helping you access that

680
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,296
We're helping you get into it so you can do it

681
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Very very very cool

682
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
Very cool

683
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,184
Show me taking a pallet back

684
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,976
With taking

685
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
The Pala

686
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
Back

687
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,096
When we take our power back

688
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,168
And it stops to build inside of us

689
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,728
We might start treating a little fear

690
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
Or a little worried

691
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,336
And then a little bit and then all of a sudden

692
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,408
You start to really shift big things

693
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,992
People stopped coming to you and you connect to their fields

694
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,552
And they go from not being able to walk the walk

695
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,136
Or they say say hey I was a diabetic continuous Chris

696
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
I did you a session

697
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
I don't need insulin anymore

698
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,000
Anything stop stop happening

699
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,584
I haven't been able to see

700
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
For 20 years

701
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:33,216
Now I got Vision clearly and Weinstein to get in another

702
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:38,336
You know just amazing amazing stuff that's coming to buy the building

703
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,152
It builds what you really build that belief

704
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
And you really stopped caring the field

705
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Because

706
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
The more work that you do

707
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
In your field

708
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,976
The more you can access and and help someone else in their field

709
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
SA

710
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,304
It's about your superconscious

711
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,400
Working with Dad superconscious and it really comes back to that but

712
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,704
All of you already are

713
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Uola

714
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,568
The common denominator

715
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,640
An old 6s

716
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
Structure

717
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,504
That's the common denominator

718
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:23,136
It is not a particular person a particular race a particular anyting

719
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,672
It is a structure

720
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,512
You can change the word structure and you could put Focus

721
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
Cuz Focus create structure

722
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,912
The common denominator that could also be set its focus

723
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,728
Where is the person focused

724
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,104
The common denominator straps massively into structure this this event

725
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
About without it

726
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,920
It is nothing

727
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
The last one

728
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:53,344
Is true choices are essential for all transformation

729
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,880
True

730
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:55,648
Choices

731
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,256
Not choices that a design to to fix something

732
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Say

733
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
We're going to learn about the observer effect

734
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:10,752
We going to learn about Fields we're going to learn about hot coherent

735
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
We're going to learn about intention

736
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
I'm going to learn about the super-conscious

737
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640
We're going to learn about a lot of things

738
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,968
And one thing that's so important

739
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,760
Is the understand

740
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,320
You are always creating

741
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
You always creating

742
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,464
You're creating the health you'll creating the sickness

743
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
You're creating

744
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
The

745
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,864
He's that disables your crane the abundance or lack of abundance

746
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
You're creating at all

747
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
You

748
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
And your superconscious is always creating

749
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,824
Who your success or failure or your fears

750
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
All your everything

751
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
If you

752
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:53,504
And it's not just that self-limited you it's all levels of you

753
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,832
You are creating it

754
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,160
So everything you have the good the bad

755
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
The in-between

756
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
Is he

757
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Is

758
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
And that is so so so upsetting

759
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
Sometimes

760
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
But also it's so empowering

761
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
SA

762
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,520
Once you really get that it's you

763
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:20,384
You get to create at all you can create more misery if that's your choice so you can create

764
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:26,272
More absolute Joy if that's your choice you can whatever you choose there's no

765
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,576
No limits no judgment it's all

766
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,856
It's all you

767
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,392
It is old

768
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:37,280
What we teach here had his Bina is been a bit of a journey really

769
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:42,912
Bunny it's it's been a very long time coming inside

770
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,704
I started out

771
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,288
On this car going

772
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
I don't really understand this will

773
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,687
Alice High School really early

774
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,735
And I didn't even finish High School

775
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,319
And the reason is is it just didn't seem right

776
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,671
I had this argument with my teachers and

777
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,743
The argument went along the lines of

778
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,791
Christy needs to come to class

779
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
And I said

780
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,143
Well why I got A's on my last test

781
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,703
I said I said

782
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,543
Why I got eyes on my last test why would I need to keep coming

783
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,591
I promise I'll get the ice

784
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,175
So now it's a it's a rule you must come School

785
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,759
I said no just give me the textbook and I'll get ice

786
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,343
So full I think two or three months licensing up to class

787
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
And

788
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
I read my textbook

789
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
And I think I got like a beat fast or something like that

790
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,071
And anyway they they told me hey

791
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
You know that to do that so

792
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,655
You know you know that back

793
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,215
And so I left

794
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,591
A-10 at that time I was playing basketball and I was playing it

795
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Professionally

796
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,711
And I got to a point where I thought you know I'm going to become a personal trainer

797
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,807
So I was actually 17 years old as a personal trainer

798
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
INR

799
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
In this time where

800
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,207
I was earning more money

801
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
And the teachers

802
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
Who just told me

803
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,863
And I couldn't understand this world

804
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,959
So I'm turning more money than them playing professional sport

805
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
And I saw these people

806
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,823
And I remember as a sixteen-year-old as I walked out

807
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Arrogant

808
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
I'll just say

809
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:32,223
I woke that and I just looked at these teachers as they expelled me from school

810
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,783
And I just said you're about your ass and loses

811
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:40,415
That's where I was at go to this place than what is this world

812
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
So I started searching

813
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
Going

814
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,119
What's up with this week is what I saw and I want you guys to kiss when I saw

815
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,911
I sold my two parents

816
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
Really unhappy

817
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,335
Really unhappy going and doing something

818
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,895
In this this

819
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
Struggle

820
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,455
They didn't love

821
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Only two

822
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,879
Support a family which included me so don't have to go to the school thing that I absolutely hate

823
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,951
And it felt to me so wrong

824
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,351
It felt so wrong did anyone else kind of get this feeling at some point in their life that

825
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,375
It stops just

826
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,143
Wrong

827
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:30,591
I just did something wrong and so look I decided I really wanted to be in business

828
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,431
So I had this this little business might my father's hit me Chris if you want to

829
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:37,759
If you want to do while in business you need to go to university

830
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,599
Same right to me so I paid my way through University

831
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,671
As a personal trainer and then is it a DJ

832
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
And his wife down at University

833
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
Number one

834
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:55,167
It was a little bit better than school because I didn't have to turn out if I didn't want so I could just get Isaiah didn't care they got paid

835
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
But soon

836
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
They were people there

837
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,823
Teaching you how to do something that they had never done

838
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,943
And again I got this this strange the strange since that

839
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,015
People were really really unhappy say she found them in for it

840
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,575
Name was Mike Tyson and he ran a pump

841
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
You're in a box

842
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:20,255
And I spent more time running business their son understand the world and handed me oldest person development books my salad to go

843
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,071
There's something more out there

844
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,911
Is more than just this white cap do 925

845
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,775
You know two hours of travel H Wyatt and going to end so I decided to look

846
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,871
An explorer that was a 15-year Journey from then to now

847
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,431
Going and asking one question is

848
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
What is it

849
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,319
What is this what is this all about

850
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,975
You know I'm just studying everything from spirituality right right through to the you know the scientific

851
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
Consciousness works

852
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,839
Through all the different healing modalities I just started think

853
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,375
What's going on

854
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,727
What this is what I created a belief

855
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
In that time

856
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
That's

857
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,383
Where I was was not good enough

858
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
And I needed to

859
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
Do something

860
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,015
It creates what it is that I wanted to create

861
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
And what happened was because of that belief I really bought into it

862
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,767
I started going around and getting to every single success seminar

863
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,047
That

864
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
That I could

865
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
Who is it who else is on this by the way

866
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
You think there has to be something out there

867
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,287
Sonora only did I go to all of these different things I also saw this many different

868
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:40,127
Businesses in relationship to stop trying and trying to get it

869
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
And it was so

870
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
Crazy to me

871
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:49,599
That every single one of them had the odd so you would follow it to get somewhere and so I just went oh and I just went

872
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
Before I went for it I went for it

873
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:57,535
And the problem was is I get a little bit of success and then I will pull down again and I'll get some success and fold down

874
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,071
Why founded

875
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,631
Is it wasn't an old areas of life

876
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,983
They typically was one area of life that everyone had

877
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
That they had a challenge

878
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,335
Whether that was their relationships within that was they help

879
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,895
Whether that was their money whether it was

880
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,479
On the spirituality whether it was whatever it was

881
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,271
They always had one

882
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:24,671
They have some places that we're going okay but there was always one that they could never figure out

883
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
And typically it was the one that was the most important to them

884
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,583
Who's going to hit the gives rolling but what I saw

885
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Was

886
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,935
People just kept on putting the palace somewhere else

887
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,519
Is it true that you know where they go

888
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,055
All right I want to be healthy

889
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
And so they got to do is they walk on down and I go to naturopath and that you had those oldies Pistons

890
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
Play hazel-e potion

891
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,575
They do that for a while I feel a little bit healthy for a bit and then go that gas

892
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,671
Then they read a book is his be vegetarian right so they go be vegetarian

893
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,999
I stopped eating they tell their friends about it and they go do that

894
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:06,655
That works for awhile that didn't then you know that's still really without then I go to find the next thing osteopath and they go

895
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,703
Go to a chiropractor then they do yoga

896
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,031
Then they then they realize it's emotional to EST

897
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,591
Reiki edmi site cakes

898
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,919
They stopped going traveling the world going to retreat

899
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:22,015
They end up doing Ayahuasca in Peru or maybe somewhere in Austin

900
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:27,391
And they're out there doing all of these things and they just keep on searching and set

901
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
And I have this shelf of knowledge

902
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
But such a lack of results

903
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,679
You say I had such a sucker and that was me

904
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
I just kept on going and grabbing and getting certified

905
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
And slowly building up

906
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
And

907
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,895
And I think that's the same for a lot of you

908
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:55,039
What happened as I would build up and got more and more and more and more and more tense

909
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,367
Elmore Toyota have more I hold onto more

910
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,951
Had to do this I had this coach for this I saw many things going on

911
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,023
Doing therapy here in Ocoee

912
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,815
Meditations here and

913
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:12,191
Getting in our sessions with Joe dispenza over here and you know what Lynne McTaggart on us doing all of this

914
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
And

915
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:19,103
It was just it was just really really really really obvious to me

916
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
That

917
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,175
Little miss something

918
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,503
But I didn't actually allow myself

919
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:30,111
I too believe it I read Robert Francis work in 2008

920
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,903
The path of least resistance

921
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,487
But it wasn't until 2017 that I really got it

922
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:41,375
And his book The Path of least resistance is a definite must-read everyone in this course

923
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,983
And you know he's he's a really really really smart guy and

924
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
Really really sweat Dawn

925
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
An insult

926
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,615
I dread that box on the back of my mind

927
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
I understood structure

928
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
I understood

929
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
That pricing used it the sales

930
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:00,063
So I used it to say Hey you know you're here

931
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,927
And you want to get debit credit structural tension and I used it to teach people how to sell

932
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,743
Kind of funny that that's what I swear I took it

933
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,023
And

934
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,047
The me

935
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,679
Everything just was like that Rob and Tay I would move towards the back

936
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
Like this

937
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
Someone will type in the book Cindy

938
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,031

I did I did all of this and then as most of you know in in 2016

941
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,111
What's on top of the world and then fell down to earth

942
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,159
Pretty fast

943
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,815

944
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,583
Business

945
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,215
Beach in the movie with Tony Robbins and everything I thought I llama was in the movie

946
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:54,591
And then my best friend was killed in a motorcycle accident who's also my business time

947
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,455
And taste was actually the person who first started

948
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,503
Yeah you saw the movie Patrick cool

949
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
He was the one that started me off with every

950
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:11,231
And so it was really interesting and most people here know this this moment

951
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,559
That's important to this poster that we go through it

952
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,351

The business

956
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,823

And it just really you know I lost my friend had all this dressing

960
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:38,879
And I realized in that moment that everything that was going on

961
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,951
It was something not right about it

962
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,303
In ri-ri connected to that
